        <p>
          DVELP is a company obsessed with creating real change in the
          communications space, especially around contact centres. To this end,
          they use Twilio and Google AI capabilities to create amazing
          experiences, both for contact centre agents and customers alike.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently working as a full-stack (Node/TypeScript/React) Senior
          Software Engineer, helping deliver client solutions through our
          professional services offering, as well as assisting with business
          functions on a day-to-day basis. I feel honoured to be included in
          many high-level business operations and decision making - DVELP truly
          is a company run by everyone it employs, not just that of some
          god-like "Senior Leadership Team".
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm also currently the InfoSec officer for the company, meaning
          there's lots of "fun" forms and questionnaires to fill out on a
          regular basis, as well as internal and external audits.

        <p>
          I decided to make the move into contracting, and started working
          through my Dad's company Steve King Consulting, offering in-house
          design and development services to his existing client-base, as well
          as updating the main website.
        </p>
        <p>
          During this time I got to play with a lot of new technologies, mainly
          centered around JAMStack, with lots of emphasis on speed and allowing
          handovers to clients which required little technical knowledge to
          maintain, using services such as Prismic to allow them an interface to
          update the content of their site without ever touching code.

          After 2 years and moving to the Vegas product, I applied for and
          received a promotion to Senior. This effectively meant my duties would
          involve more decision making and planning for the future of our
          product(s), as well as giving more guidance to junior developers. As I
          had grown to be a "go to" point of contact for most people outside of
          my squad, this promotion also recognised that status as someone to
          trust regarding what could/couldn't be done and in what timeframe.
        </p>
        <p>
          I continued to write code, however more and more ended up reviewing
          and pairing with others to improve our code quality overall, as tech
          moves fast and somehow SBG moved faster! We used bleeding-edge
          front-end tech such as Next with React all coded in TypeScript. The
          back-end was being updated from PHP to Next and Node, with the
          pipelines all being run through Jenkins. We were also moving from a
          Chef-on-prem docker stack to an AWS docker stack.

        <p>
          I was offered a job via the refer-a-friend scheme, and was placed into
          the Gaming tribe into the "One To Go" Squad, which is responsible for
          the Sky Bingo product. This is a high-performance product, which
          serves hundreds-of-thousands of visitors a week, and thus is built to
          the most rigorous of performance standards using a combination of PHP
          and JavaScript (React/Flux). The site is fully responsive, and the one
          codebase must work across all screen sizes, devices, and both an
          Android and iOS application.
        </p>
        <p>
          We practice peer-code-reviews as a matter of course for all changes
          for the site (no matter how small), and the whole site is deployed by
          a continuous integration pipeline built around Jenkins; in short, the
          whole product is super modern, adhering to the current best coding
          practices.

          Primarily working with ASP.Net (both Visual Basic and C# components),
          my responsibilities included maintaining the bespoke behemoth website
          of highfieldabc.com. This was a huge system, that handled every part
          of the business, from sales, users, managing learners and courses,
          validation, interacting with examination systems (both in house and
          third party), and providing and consuming various services.

          Early in my employment, I was tasked with rebuilding their Dubai site
          to bring it roughly in line with modern web design (an improvement
          from the 2006-esque look). I did this, but also created a mockup of a
          Bootstrap-powered responsive site and provided that alongside. The
          directors saw this and asked me to make this the focus of design for
          all the Highfield online products going forward. This has been built
          using Angular, leveraging ASP MVC, RESTful services, and Azure.

        <p>
          I worked at Verizon as part of a 12-week internship program in the
          Software Development department. I was assigned to work on an
          extension to an existing Billing & ERP System, which used Oracle
          PL/SQL, a language I had never worked with before. As well as this
          development, I also had to quickly grasp how to use/work in UNIX,
          including working in vi to edit shell and perl scripts.
        </p>
        <p>
          After this project was mostly completed, I was moved to work on a
          different critical system, which is used to handle the connection
          status of "high risk" accounts. The system front-end needed completely
          rewriting into Java/HTML/CSS from Flex, interacting with a different
          PL/SQL system. This also required me to work with the offshore team
          based in India, which was a learning experience for myself; after
          going from never having a conference call, to having a 5 hour time
          difference was interesting, to say the least.
