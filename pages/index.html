            Hi, I'm <span class="em">James King</span>, and I make things for
            the web. As you can probably tell, I'm a fan of minimalist designs
            that help you get the information you need, with the minimum of
            fuss.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also really, <span class="em2">really</span> like big, bold,
            oh-my-gosh-that's-so-bright colours.

            During my time as a nerd, I've made quite a lot of things; both
            professionally and personally. Let's take a walk down memory lane
            and have a look at them.

            Who doesn&apos;t love a good blog?
          </p>
          <p>
            Here you&apos;ll find ramblings, how-to-guides, reviews, and
            possibly even something a little more professional... although who
            knows on that last one. This is my personal site after all.

            So who is this mysterious being, <span class="em2">ripixel</span>?
          </p>
          <p>
            Hopefully you&apos;ll have read the first page, and know that my
            proper boring name is <span class="em">James King</span>. But in
            case that wasn&apos;t enough for you, I&apos;ve put together a lot
            more information for you to gobble up.
