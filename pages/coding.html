        <h3>ripixel.co.uk</h3>
        <p>
          This website! It&apos;s cool, isn&apos;t it? Why use a static site
          generator when you can just... y&apos;know... write the HTML yourself?
        </p>
        <p>
          As with all personal sites, I&apos;ve been going back and forth on how
          to implement it for literally <span class="em2">years</span>. Should I
          go all swanky and amazing and use the latest tech? Should I show off
          all my awesome React skills?
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, I decided to go as simple-as-possible. This site
          shouldn&apos;t be all-singing-and-dancing, because it&apos;s not
          what&apos;s needed. What&apos;s needed is something super simple,
          clean, and most importanly
          <span class="em2">quick</span>. So, it&apos;s pure HTML and CSS, with
          a really simple template copy/paste script so I don&apos;t have to
          write the nav/header/footer out everytime. Neat!

        <h3>Janky Werewolf</h3>
        <p>
          A browser-based version of the Ultimate Werewolf card game
        </p>
        <p>
          Created during the great-lockdown of &apos;20, my friends and I adore
          the Ultimate Werewolf game, and would play it every evening whenever
          we met up. However, as meetings turned virtual, there was no way to do
          this! So what did we do as a bunch of CompSci nerds? Create our own
          web version of course!
        </p>
        <p>
          The front-end is made in React, utilising Websockets to talk to
          lambdas that handle the running of the game and tracking of game state
          (aka who's dead Jim). The back-end is written by
          <a href="https://www.mgoddard.net/">Michael Goddard</a>, the big ol'
          Rust nerd.
