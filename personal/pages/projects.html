      <h3>FitGlue</h3>
      <p>
        An automation platform for fitness enthusiasts who are tired of
        manually copying their workouts between apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ever finished a killer workout on one app and then had to faff about
        re-entering it all somewhere else? Yeah, me too. FitGlue connects your
        fitness services together and automatically syncs activities between
        them, with some magical enrichment thrown in along the way &ndash;
        AI-generated descriptions, parkrun result lookups, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&apos;s built on a React frontend with a Go and TypeScript backend, all running on
        Google Cloud. The &quot;Magician&quot; design system ensures
        everything looks premium with glassmorphism effects and subtle
        animations. Because if you&apos;re going to automate your fitness
        life, it should at least look <span class="em2">fancy</span>.

      <h3>Skier</h3>
      <p>
        A custom static site generator, because the world definitely needed
        another one of those.
      </p>
      <p>
        I kept finding myself building static sites and getting frustrated
        with the existing options &ndash; they were either too simple or
        required me to learn an entire framework just to render some HTML
        templates. So I did what any sensible developer would do: spent
        considerably more time building my own solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Skier is a task-based build system that transforms JSON and Markdown
        into static HTML. It handles everything from pagination to RSS feeds
        to SEO sitemaps. It powers this very website, the FitGlue marketing
        pages, and the Bingham Sunday Running Club site. Is it overkill?
        Absolutely. Does it bring me joy? <span class="em2">Also yes</span>.

      <h3>Bingham Sunday Running Club</h3>
      <p>
        A full digital ecosystem for a small town running club that
        probably didn&apos;t need this level of engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        What started as &quot;can you make us a simple website?&quot; turned
        into a React-based race tracker app, a Skier-powered club website, and
        an automated CI/CD pipeline that would make enterprise teams jealous.
        Every Sunday morning, the race director tracks laps on their phone, and
        by the time the slowest runner (hi, that&apos;s often me) finishes,
        the results are already live on the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Features include automatic personal best tracking, a runners directory
        with individual profiles, Spotify playlist integration, and even
        weather data enrichment for historical runs. Because nothing says
        &quot;casual Sunday jog&quot; like comprehensive data analytics.

      <h3>State Management Examples</h3>
      <p>
        As a lover of state management in React (I know, what a weird thing to admit) I often get asked about my
        thoughts as to the best state management solutions out there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone who's delved into the mysteries and intricacies of managing state in React knows that that's a very
        naive question, which misses the big point that there are pros and cons to almost every approach, with some
        being suited to more complex codebases with multiple teams contributing, and others being far more manageable
        for single teams or solo developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I put together a lil website to showcase how to get started with a number of state management libraries.
        Take a look!
      </p>

      <h3>Presentation Timer</h3>
      <p>
        A simple presentation countdown timer with music streaming for use
        on streams/presentations - because every stream could use some
        suspense and music!
      </p>
      <p>
        When doing presentations, it's nice to have a countdown to the start
        at the beginning, and it's even nicer to have some music playing in
        the background. However, combining these two things usually means a
        lot of messing around with audio inputs/outputs, or you just resort
        to playing the music out your speakers and detecting it with your
        microphone, or capturing your entire machine's audio.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having the presentation countdown and the music playing in the same
        tab means most streaming tools can pick up the audio in a nice way.

      <h3>Janky Werewolf</h3>
      <p>A browser-based version of the Ultimate Werewolf card game</p>
      <p>
        Created during the great-lockdown of &apos;20, my friends and I
        adore the Ultimate Werewolf game, and would play it every evening
        whenever we met up. However, as meetings turned virtual, there was
        no way to do this! So what did we do as a bunch of CompSci nerds?
        Create our own web version of course!
      </p>
      <p>
        The front-end is made in React, utilising Websockets to talk to
        lambdas that handle the running of the game and tracking of game
        state (aka who&apos;s dead Jim). The back-end is written by
        <a href="https://www.mgoddard.net/">Michael Goddard</a>, the big
        ol&apos; Rust nerd.

      <h3>ripixel.co.uk</h3>
      <p>
        This website! It&apos;s cool, isn&apos;t it? Why use a static site
        generator when you can just... y&apos;know... write the HTML yourself?
      </p>
      <p>
        As with all personal sites, I&apos;ve been going back and forth on how
        to implement it for literally <span class="em2">years</span>. Should I
        go all swanky and amazing and use the latest tech? Should I show off
        all my awesome React skills?
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, I decided to go as simple-as-possible. This site
        shouldn&apos;t be all-singing-and-dancing, because it&apos;s not
        what&apos;s needed. What&apos;s needed is something super simple,
        clean, and most importantly
        <span class="em2">quick</span>. So, it&apos;s pure HTML and CSS, with
        a really simple template copy/paste script so I don&apos;t have to
        write the nav/header/footer out everytime. Neat!
